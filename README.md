# Smart-Desk-Ontology
In this repository you can find a simple example about Ambient Intelligence applicaitons which is  **A smart desk**. The application is built as a topological onotology on Protegé.

# Protegé
[Protegé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) is A free, open-source ontology editor and framework for building intelligent systems

# What is a smart desk?
Smart desk is a desk that allows you to complete your work or study in a more comfortable way by providing you with a set of smart features that minimize the workload, the time management and extend the working period. Also, it can recognize some activities that you are doing, as well as give you some useful suggestions.

# Topological Ontology 
It is build by defining **Entities, data properties, object properties and SWRL rules**, the reasoner used is **Pallet**

## Entities
Here is the list of classes and sub-classes used in this ontology 
  1- DeskComponent:  The component of the smart desk which are Chair and Desk
  2- DeskFeatures: The features provided (actions done) by the smart desk which are executed based on a specific condition. They are codded by SWRL rules.
